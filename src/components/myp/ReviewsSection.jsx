Their in-depth knowledge of physics is incredible, and their passion for the subject shines through in everything they do in class. As a slow student, I really appreciate the effort they put into making sure that I understand the concepts we are studying. They have a remarkable talent for explaining complex ideas in a way that is easy to understand, and they always take the time to answer my questions and provide examples that clarify the material. I also value the way they challenge me to think critically and to develop my own understanding of the subject. Their question-and-answer skills are second to none, and I always feel supported and encouraged when I ask for help. I feel incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from them.I am doing IB English. The instructor’s passion for the subject shines through in every lesson, and their dedication to my learning is truly inspiring. I appreciate that they always challenge me to go beyond surface-level analysis of literature and encourage me to dive deeper into the text. Their feedback on my work is invaluable and has helped me improve my writing and critical thinking skills tremendously. I also love the variety of materials and resources provided in class, and the way different English language techniques are introduced. I am doing IB Economics. As a first-time economics student, I was initially intimidated by the subject, but the instructor has made it so much easier to understand. Their method of starting the first class by asking questions about the economy was such a brilliant way to engage me in the subject. I know I ended up asking a silly question, but it was handled so gracefully, and I appreciate their patience with me in class. I have to say, I look forward to every class because of how interesting they make the discussions. Their ability to make the subject matter relatable and engaging is commendable. The notes are also amazing!",
